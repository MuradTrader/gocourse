## Explanation "From Scratch"

### What a File Is and How a Computer Stores It

When you open any **text editor** (for example, Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text) and start typing characters, they are stored sequentially as **"bytes"** in the computer. Bytes are the most basic **"building blocks"** of information that any disk (**HDD** or **SSD**) can store and that **RAM** (Random Access Memory) can remember.

A **file** is simply a collection of bytes saved under a specific **filename** (for example, `hello.go`) within a particular **folder** (directory). The computer stores information on the disk regarding the file's name, its location, and the number of bytes it contains.

This is a great follow-up! This text introduces a very important concept in IT: **file extensions** and **compilation**.

Here is the professional English translation, followed by a breakdown of the technical terms.

## Why do we need the `.go` extension?

An **extension** is what is written after the **dot** in a filename. For example: `document.txt`, `picture.jpg`, or `script.js`. Extensions help both you and the computer (specifically, the **operating system** and your applications) understand what type of data you are dealing with: text, an image, a video, or code in a specific language, and so on.

If you write plain text and save it as `note.txt`, the operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and many programs will think: "This is just a regular text file." Similarly, when you save a file named `hello.go`, you and all the tools related to the **Go language** understand: "Okay, this is a **Go source file**; it needs to be processed by a special program — the **Go compiler**."

If you named your code `hello.txt` instead of `hello.go` and then tried to run `go run hello.txt`, the Go compiler would respond: "I don't understand — I don't have a file with a `.go` extension to **compile**. This isn't a program; it's just text!"
